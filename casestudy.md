~ 40,000 convicts

~ 1 million rows of data

Collaboration: Submitting convict ancestors
	
#### What we hope to do

Digitising historical sources

Collaboration: Correcting transcriptions

#### Problems/challenges

'Amateur' developer

Isolation

## Why Drupal?

#### Free

Values: free, open

Low cost

#### Web framework

Modular

Define our own content types and views

Define user roles

Workflow

#### Why *Drupal*?

Decision up to one developer

Exposure to Drupal on many other sites

## Modules

### Communication

#### Simplenews

## Usability issues

#### Theme

I am not a designer

Fusion starter theme

#### Accounts/registration

Why don't users follow instructions?

'Please give me a password'

Confusion with Simplenews subscriptions

#### Privatemsg

Stores messages in Drupal database

(don't just rely on email)

But users reply to the notification email

(even though I say not to, IN ALL CAPS)

#### Other project staff

Not using the site

Not giving me feedback

#### Questions/advice?
