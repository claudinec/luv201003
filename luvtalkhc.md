#### What we have done

~ 40,000 convicts

~ 1 million rows of data

Collaboration: Submitting convict ancestors

#### What we hope to do

Digitising historical sources

Collaboration: Correcting transcriptions

#### Problems/challenges

'Amateur' developer

Isolation

## Humanities computing

#### 'Humanities computing'

Or 'digital humanities'?

#### Old questions, new tools?

Digitisation

Analyse large[r] amounts of material

Public access and collaboration

#### The Valley of the Shadow

## Why FOSS?

#### Why FOSS?

Use of resources

Community of developers

Using and adapting tools

Access

Values

#### Use of resources

Expenses:

- Processing power
- Storage
- Bandwidth

#### Community of developers

Mutual support

Don’t reinvent the wheel

#### Using and adapting tools

e.g. TEI, GEDCOM

#### Access

Make archival sources and research results accessible to general public

e.g. online museums

Sharing data with other researchers

#### Values

Public interest

Free access, free expression

Dialogue

Public participation

## Why Drupal?

#### Free

Values: free, open

Low cost

#### Web framework

Modular

Define our own content types and views

Define user roles

Workflow

#### Why *Drupal*?

Decision up to one developer

Exposure to Drupal on many other sites

## Challenges

#### The Two Cultures

*The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution*

CP Snow, Rede Lecture, 1959

Literature/humanities vs science/tech

#### Many cultures?

Translating between academics, IT professionals, diverse public audience

Different priorities, research questions

#### Geeks and non-geeks

Non-geeks may not understand the values behind FOSS

Technology as magic

#### Where do developers belong?

Identity crisis

'Digital humanities professional'?

Background -- IT or academic?

Autonomy

Career progression

Where do humanities computing projects belong?

#### Resources and evaluation

Resource needs and output not like in traditional academic projects

In: computer resources, not just research time

Out: software, web, data, not just articles

#### Evolving field

Challenging

Exciting
