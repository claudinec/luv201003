Presentation on humanities computing for LUV, March 2010.

Humanities computing, Drupal and What I did on my holidays

This presentation will introduce the opportunities that free software
and the web present for research, publication and collaboration in the
humanities, particularly in the area of public history. I will discuss
some of the technical and social challenges I have faced on the Founders
and Survivors project, and will demonstrate how I am using Drupal to
implement the data collection and presentation tasks for this project.

This is a mashup of two presentations I gave at LCA and DrupalSouth in
Wellington in January, now with added Drupal goodness thanks to the
feedback I received.


(what I did on my holidays: NZ, LCA2010, DrupalSouth)

Unlocking the ivory tower

make history (resources, interpretation) accessible to general
public

we are all historians; we have our own stories; history matters to
us in some way

'libraries' and 'museums' (rather than literary vs historical
dichotomy)

examples: Perseus, Valley, Old Bailey

FAS: paper databases -- many kinds of document

Drupal: the state of the project

public submissions of convicts: convsub content type, registration,
user profiles (usability issues)

copy of index: table wizard, migrate

in progress: (manually) linking official index with public
submissions (later life stories, WWI links)
